# Restaurants

This is a project I made in 2018 for the final exam in high school therefor it's very raw and it's mostly in my native language (italian).

This web application allows owners to put their restaurants online so that the clients can look through the menu, the prices and the photos of the dishes and make a reservations for a specific date.

<h2>Instructions</h2>

If you want to test it you'll need a web server and MySQL.<br/>
You can change the database settings on the env.json file.<br/>
Import the file db_setup.sql which will create the database and all the tables you need to save the data.
